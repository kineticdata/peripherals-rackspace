=== Detailed Description
This handler creates a server from the Rackspace Cloud. After creating the 
Rackspace service, the gem searches for the image and flavor objects based on
the names inputted as parameters. Once those objects are found, the call is sent
to Rackspace to create the server. The handler then returns information about
the server that was just created. Any errors that are encountered will be caught
and re-raised by the handler.
